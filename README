INSTALLATION

Prerequisites:
 - Working internet connection (for running the tests)
 - JSON CPAN module (and JSON::XS for speed!)

Recommended CPAN modules:
 - Log::Log4perl (if you want to log to a file instead of STDERR)
 - File::Which (if you want to use WWW::EchoNest::Song::identify -- see
    ECHOPRINT below)

To install this module, run the following commands:

	$ perl Build.PL
	$ ./Build
	$ ./Build test
	$ ./Build install

Note:
 - You may see a warning
     << Could not read ECHO_NEST_API_KEY env var.
        Your api key may need to be hardcoded into WWW/EchoNest/Preferences.pm >>
    You should be able to ignore this warning during installation with no
    problems.
 - The easiest way to let WWW::EchoNest see your EN api key is

ECHOPRINT

The Echo Nest has released an open-source audio analyzer called 'echoprint'.
If you wish to use the WWW::EchoNest::Song::identify function then you will
have to have echoprint installed and working properly on your system.

See <http://echoprint.me/> for more information.

After getting echoprint up and running, you should either edit
WWW/EchoNest/Config.pm to hardcode the 'codegen_binary_override' field
or call set_codegen_path from any programs that use Song::identify.

e.g.
<pre>
use WWW::EchoNest qw( set_codegen_path );
use WWW::EchoNest::Song qw( identify );
my $song = identify( { filename => 'path/to/audio_file.mp3' } );
</pre>

Two more things you have to do before using Song::identify:
- Install ffmpeg. (See <http://ffmpeg.org>)
- Install File::Which from CPAN.
  - This is how WWW::EchoNest finds the location of
